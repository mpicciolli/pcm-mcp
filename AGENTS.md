# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Pro Cycling Manager (PCM) game
saves to an LLM client over stdio. PCM stores careers as binary `.cdb` files; this
server discovers and inspects those saves and **never modifies the source save**.
Each call re-reads the `.cdb` from disk and loads it into an in-memory sql.js
(SQLite) database (via `cdb-converter`), so the on-disk save is the single source
of truth. Write tools (`pcm_update_save`, `pcm_update_cyclist_ratings`) mutate the
in-memory copy and serialize it to a **new** `.cdb` via `writeSaveDb`, which
refuses to overwrite the source or any existing file. Any new tool must keep this
never-touch-the-source guarantee.

## Stack

- **Runtime/lang:** Node.js (ESM, `bundler` module resolution), TypeScript (strict).
- **MCP:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — `McpServer` + `StdioServerTransport`.
- **Save parsing:** `cdb-converter` (`cdbToSql`) + `sql.js` (in-memory SQLite).
- **Schemas:** `zod` for tool input/output schemas.
- **Build:** `tsup` → `dist/` (ESM output; `.d.ts` currently disabled). **Test:** `vitest`.
  **Lint/format:** `biome`.

## Tools

All tools are prefixed with `pcm_`. Read tools carry `readOnlyHint: true` / `destructiveHint: false` annotations so clients can auto-approve them; the two write tools (`pcm_update_save`, `pcm_update_cyclist_ratings`) carry `readOnlyHint: false` / `destructiveHint: true`.

| Tool                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pcm_list_saves`             | Discover `.cdb` careers by scanning `Pro Cycling Manager <year>/Cloud` under `%APPDATA%` (**Windows only**).                                                                                                                                          |
| `pcm_select_save`            | Validate a `.cdb` path and return metadata. Stateless — the path must be kept in conversation context for later tools.                                                                                                                                |
| `pcm_get_save_schema`        | List all tables (id + name) in a save via `DB_STRUCTURE`.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pcm_get_table_schema`       | Inspect one table: columns (name, type, NOT NULL, PK) + row count.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pcm_get_player_info`        | Active human player + team (joins `GAM_user` `game_i_active = 1` with `DYN_team`).                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pcm_get_team_roster`        | Team roster (defaults to active player's team). Joins `DYN_cyclist` with active `DYN_contract_cyclist` + `STA_type_rider`: name, country, age, type, overall, contract end, wage, value, plus per-terrain ratings (flat). Errors on unknown `teamId`. |
| `pcm_search_cyclist`         | Search cyclist by first/last name (partial, case-insensitive).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `pcm_search_team`            | Search team by name (partial, case-insensitive; matches full name and short name).                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pcm_query_save`             | Run a single read-only `SELECT`/`WITH … SELECT`. Write/DDL rejected; results capped (default 100, max 1000).                                                                                                                                          |
| `pcm_update_save`            | Apply a single `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` to a save and write the result to a **new** `.cdb` (`outputPath` must differ from `savePath`). SELECT/DDL/stacked statements rejected.                                                                      |
| `pcm_update_cyclist_ratings` | Change one or more `charac_i_*` ratings of a cyclist (by `IDcyclist`, ratings 55–85) and write the result to a **new** `.cdb`. Returns the cyclist's full ratings after the update.                                                                   |
| `pcm_generate_startlist_xml` | Build a PCM startlist XML from teams + rosters; derives the file name from `STA_race.gene_sz_filename` for the given `IDrace`.                                                                                                                        |

## Conventions

- **State is in the conversation, not the server.** Tools are stateless; every
  save-reading tool takes an absolute `savePath` and re-validates it via
  `validateSave`. There is no "current save".
- **Use `withSaveDb` for new save-reading tools.** It centralises validate →
  read → convert → run → always-close. Some existing tools (`get_save_schema`,
  `get_player_info`, `query_save`) still inline this boilerplate; prefer
  `withSaveDb` and consider migrating them when touched.
- **Read-only is enforced defensively** even though the DB is in-memory — see
  `assertReadOnlyQuery` in `query-save.ts` (single statement, SELECT/WITH only,
  forbidden-keyword guard).
- **Guard against SQL injection** when interpolating identifiers: validate table
  names against `DB_STRUCTURE` before building queries (see `get_table_schema`).
- **Tool responses** go through `validResponse` / `errorResponse`; declare both
  `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` with zod.
- **Tool annotations** — every tool must include `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
  `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint`. Read tools use `readOnlyHint: true` /
  `destructiveHint: false`; write tools the inverse.
- **Tool naming** — all tools are prefixed with `pcm_` (e.g. `pcm_list_saves`) to
  avoid conflicts when used alongside other MCP servers.
- **Platform:** auto-discovery is Windows-only. On macOS/Linux (Wine/Proton),
  `pcm_list_saves`/`getPcmRoot` throw — pass an absolute `.cdb` path to `pcm_select_save`.
- **Logging** must go to `stderr` (`console.error`); stdout is the MCP transport.

## README maintenance

After any change that affects the public interface of this server, update `README.md`
before considering the task done. This includes:

- Adding, removing, or renaming a tool
- Changing a tool's inputs, outputs, or description
- Changing platform support or installation requirements
- Changing the MCP transport or Claude Desktop configuration

The tool table in `README.md` must always match the exact tool names registered in the
source (currently prefixed with `pcm_`).

## Collaboration And Release Conventions

- Respect standard JavaScript library conventions for commits, pull requests, tags, and releases.
- Prefer Conventional Commit style when proposing commit messages or PR titles, especially for changes that affect release notes or semantic versioning.
- Keep pull requests focused, with a clear scope, user-visible impact, and explicit note when a change is breaking.
- Treat versioning and release artifacts as semver-driven. Breaking API or packaging changes must be clearly identified so they can drive a major release.
- Prefer annotated version tags that match the package release version format, such as `v0.1.0`, unless the repository documents another convention.
- When preparing release-related changes, make sure changelog, package metadata, exports, and release notes stay coherent with the actual API and runtime compatibility.
